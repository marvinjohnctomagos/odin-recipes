        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and a garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>  cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>  cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
