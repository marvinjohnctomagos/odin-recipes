        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lobster Thermidor is a French dish of lobster meat cooked in a rich wine sauce, stuffed back into a lobster shell, and browned. The sauce is often a mixture of egg yolks and brandy (such as Cognac), served with an oven-browned cheese crust, typically Gruy√®re. The sauce originally contained mustard (typically powdered mustard).</p>
        <p>Lobster Thermidor is surprisingly simple to make at home for a stunning meal for two. Lobster shells are stuffed with cooked lobster in a creamy white wine sauce, topped with Parmesan cheese, and broiled until golden.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium (1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pound) cooked lobster</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shallot; cook and stir until tender.</li>
            <li>Mix in fish stock, white wine, and cream. Bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by half. Mix in parsley, lemon juice, mustard, salt, and pepper.</li>
